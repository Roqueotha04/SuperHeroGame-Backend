# 🦸 SuperHero Game – Backend API

## Overview


**SuperHero Game** is a production-ready backend application built with **Java 17** and **Spring Boot 3**.  
It powers a superhero battle platform with secure authentication, personalized features, and real-world account lifecycle management.

The system handles:

- 📧 Email confirmation and password recovery flows
- 🐳 Docker containerization
- ☁️ Cloud-native deployment
- 🔑 Environment-based secure configuration
- 🔐 Secure JWT-based authentication
- 🛡 Password encryption with BCrypt
- 🏗 Clean layered architecture

This project was built to reflect how modern backend systems are structured, secured, and deployed in real production environments.

## 🚀 Performance Optimization (Anti-Cold Start Strategy)

Since this project is hosted on free tiers (**Render** for the Backend and **Neon** for PostgreSQL), the system would naturally face "Cold Starts" (latency up to 50s after inactivity). I have implemented a three-layered solution to ensure an immediate, professional user experience:

### 1. Database Warm-up Strategy
* **The Challenge:** Neon DB enters a sleep state after 5 minutes of inactivity to save resources.
* **The Solution:** The Frontend (`Angular`) triggers a silent "warm-up" request to the backend via `ngOnInit` as soon as the landing page loads.
* **The Result:** While the user spends time on the welcome screen, the DB connection is restored in the background. By the time they click Login or Register, the response is near-instant (< 2s).

### 2. High Availability Monitoring (Keep-Alive)
* **The Solution:** Integrated **UptimeRobot** to perform constant health-check pings to the Spring Boot Actuator endpoint.
* **The Result:** This prevents the Render instance from spinning down, keeping the application context loaded in memory and ready to serve requests.

### 3. Optimized Connection Pooling
* **The Solution:** Fine-tuned **HikariCP** parameters within Spring Boot to manage short-lived connections.
* **The Result:** This configuration is specifically tailored for Serverless PostgreSQL environments, preventing memory leaks and ensuring stable performance under the project's group ID: `com.superherogame`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Maven
- Spring Boot 3
- PostgreSQL (Neon Cloud)
- Render (Backend Deployment)
- Vercel (Frontend Deployment – Angular)
- Docker
- Spring Security 6

## 🏗 Architecture

The project follows a clean layered architecture:

### 🏗 Layer Responsibilities

- 🎮 **Controllers** → REST endpoints exposed to the client
- 🧠 **Services** → Core business logic and rules enforcement
- 🔄 **Mapper** → DTO ↔ Entity transformation
- 📦 **DTO** → Request & Response models
- 🗃 **Entities** → JPA domain models mapped to the database
- 🗄 **Repositories** → Data access layer (Spring Data JPA)
- ❗ **Exception** → Custom exceptions + GlobalExceptionHandler
- ⚙️ **Config** → Security & Mail configuration
- 🔐 **Utils** → JWT generation and validation utilities

---

## 🔐 Security & Authentication

The system uses **Spring Security 6** with **stateless JWT authentication**.

### Authentication Flow

1. User signs up
2. Confirmation email is sent
3. User confirms account via token
4. User logs in and receives a JWT
5. JWT is required for protected endpoints

### Token Strategy

Three token types are implemented:

- Authentication Token
- Email Confirmation Token (1 hour expiration)
- Password Reset Token (30 minutes expiration)

Each token includes:

- HMAC256 signature
- Issuer validation
- Expiration validation
- Subject (User ID)

## 📧 Email Integration

Integrated using **JavaMailSender (Gmail SMTP)**.

Used for:

- Account confirmation
- Password recovery
- Confirmation email re-sending

This simulates a real production-grade authentication lifecycle.

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

### Backend
- Hosted on Render
- Public production environment

### Database
- PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Tech

### Frontend
- Angular application deployed on Vercel

This separation reflects a real-world production architecture:

Frontend → Backend API → Cloud Database

---

## 🔑 Environment Variables

The application uses environment variables for secure production configuration:

- EMAIL_PASS
- JWT_SECRET
- POSTGRESDATABASE
- POSTGRESHOST
- POSTGRESPASSWORD
- POSTGRESPORT
- POSTGRESUSERNAME

Sensitive credentials are never hardcoded.
